Revision history for Perl extension Hash::Search.

0.03  Sun Jun 21 13:37:15 2009
	- Hash::Search is now a object orientated module so you will

0.02  Tue Apr 25 04:11:25 2009
	- Removed 'use 5.8.0' in both Makefile.PL and the module itself as 
	  certain testers for Perl 5.6.2 were unable to use this module yet
	  upon further testing the module appears to work fine in Perl 5.6.2
	  through 'make test'.
	- Changed META.yml to make it compliant.
